Things to do with twsearch:

* Speed up pruning table generation when ignore pieces or many identical
  pieces so canonical sequences are less effective, by reducing number
  of prefixes.

* Ignore pieces
  - Introduce way to specify certain pieces can be ignored for pruning

* Split into many files for simplicity

* Twophase integrated (for speed)

* In phase 2, support solving multiple positions concurrently rather than
  parallelizing searches that are not deep

* In phase 2, somewhat randomize incoming positions (since nearby ones appear
  to be related)

* Coset solver:
  - Allow spec of subset for pruning (i.e., centers, corners, perms, ori)
  - Encode other portions and store in bitmap
  - Use this for God's number calculations
  - Think about how to do move-subset-based cosets

* Orientation reduction
  - Can we infer orientation somehow?

* Edge pairing
  - Is there some way we can support edge pairing?

* Structural pruning
  - Non-table-based pruning based on (for instance) pairs of pieces and
    their relationships.

* Multiple pruning tables
  - Get deep values from a subset of the puzzle (i.e., corners on the 4x4)

* Multiple probes
  - Support a mechanism for multiple probing into a single table, maybe
    in conjunction with the move subset discussed above

* Display, etc.
  - Add some way to render/edit positions, perhaps in conjunction with
    SVG twizzle support or something.

* Cycle-based movement for speed?

* Play with solving piece by piece; see what we can do.
