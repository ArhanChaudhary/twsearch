Things to do with twsearch:

* Coset solver:
  - Allow spec of subset for pruning (i.e., centers, corners, perms, ori)
  - Encode other portions and store in bitmap
  - Use this for God's number calculations
  - Think about how to do move-subset-based cosets

* Orientation reduction
  - Can we infer orientation somehow?

* Simple algorithm search
  - Conjugates, commutators, repeated sequences

* Low-value pruning improvement
  - Divide by 127, or other hack, to preserve 4 bits per cacheline for a
    lower value, like we do in our big optimal solver

* Ignore pieces
  - Introduce way to specify certain pieces can be ignored for pruning

* Edge pairing
  - Is there some way we can support edge pairing?

* Structural pruning
  - Non-table-based pruning based on (for instance) pairs of pieces and
    their relationships.

* Multiple pruning tables
  - Get deep values from a subset of the puzzle (i.e., corners on the 4x4)

* Multiple probes
  - Support a mechanism for multiple probing into a single table, maybe
    in conjunction with the move subset discussed above

* Display, etc.
  - Add some way to render/edit positions, perhaps in conjunction with
    SVG twizzle support or something.

* Cycle-based movement for speed?

* Play with solving piece by piece; see what we can do.
